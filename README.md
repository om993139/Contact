## ðŸ—‚ Code Structure
MVVM Architecture
The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern:

Model: Represents the data and business logic. It includes Room database entities and DAOs.
ViewModel: Acts as a mediator between the View (UI) and Model. It manages UI-related data and communicates with the backend or repository.
View: The UI layer built using Jetpack Compose, which displays data and interacts with users.
Dependency Injection
Dependency injection using Hilt is utilized to manage app dependencies:

Purpose: Helps in creating a modular and testable codebase by providing dependencies to classes.
Advantages: Enhances code readability, maintainability, and scalability.
Room Database
Room is employed for local database operations:

Functionality: Provides an abstraction layer over SQLite for efficient storage and management of contacts locally.
Advantages: Enables seamless data handling operations like insertion, deletion, and updating of contact records.





## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

The app uses the following dependencies:

- **AndroidX Libraries**: For backward compatibility and modern Android development.
- **Jetpack Compose**: For building the UI.
- **Hilt**: For dependency injection.
- **Room**: For local database storage.
- **Material Components**: For modern UI components using Material3.

Add these dependencies in your `build.gradle.kts` file:
```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("androidx.core:core-ktx:1.7.0")
    implementation("androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-ktx:2.4.0")
    implementation("androidx.activity:activity-compose:1.4.0")
